A hat with an RTC, so crystal, and what else? Some attempts add an I2C circuit, so that it's easy to communicate with the Zero. So long for the RTC that does exist in the H3, but that is not wired anywhere.
The status of the RTC on the Zero is not really [clear](https://forum.armbian.com/topic/13137-orange-pi-zero-internal-rtc/) to me.
We should maybe have a look at [this documentation](https://epsilonrt.fr/2020/01/rtc-armbian/?doing_wp_cron=1608288451.0372149944305419921875).
Sorry, it's in french.
